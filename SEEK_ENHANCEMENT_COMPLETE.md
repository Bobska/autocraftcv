  - `needs_review`: Flags jobs that may need manual verification
  - `site_domain`: Records the source domain for analytics
- **Migration Applied**: Database schema updated successfully

### 📋 **Testing Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Test Enhanced SEEK Scraping**
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000
2. Try scraping a SEEK job URL (e.g., from https://seek.com.au/jobs)
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Protected sites will attempt anti-detection scraping first
   - If successful: Job extracted with enhanced protection
   - If blocked: Automatic redirect to manual entry with pre-filled URL

#### **Step 2: Test Manual Entry with AI Parsing**
1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/manual-entry/
2. Copy and paste a complete job posting text (from SEEK or any site)
3. Click "Parse with AI" button
4. **Expected Results**:
   - AI automatically extracts job title, company, location, etc.
   - Form fields populated with parsed data
   - Review and submit the job posting

#### **Step 3: Test Fallback Workflow**
1. Try scraping a heavily protected URL
2. **Expected Flow**:
   - Standard scraping → Anti-detection scraping → Manual entry suggestion
   - Each step provides user feedback and guidance
   - No dead ends or errors - always a path forward
